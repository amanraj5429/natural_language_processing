            "Jane Fairfax was very elegant, remarkably elegant; and she had\n",

            "there was more beauty in them altogether than she had remembered;\n",
            "it was not regular, but it was very pleasing beauty.  Her eyes,\n",
            "a deep grey, with dark eye-lashes and eyebrows, had never been denied\n",
            "their praise; but the skin, which she had been used to cavil at,\n",
            "as wanting colour, had a clearness and delicacy which really needed\n",
            "no fuller bloom.  It was a style of beauty, of which elegance\n",
            "was the reigning character, and as such, she must, in honour,\n",
            "by all her principles, admire it:--elegance, which, whether of person\n",
            "or of mind, she saw so little in Highbury.  There, not to be vulgar,\n",

            "In short, she sat, during the first visit, looking at Jane Fairfax\n",
            "with twofold complacency; the sense of pleasure and the sense\n",
            "of rendering justice, and was determining that she would dislike\n",
            "her no longer.  When she took in her history, indeed, her situation,\n",

            "her to interest, were added the highly probable circumstance\n",
            "of an attachment to Mr. Dixon, which she had so naturally started\n",
            "to herself.  In that case, nothing could be more pitiable\n",

            "which her imagination had suggested at first.  If it were love,\n",
            "it might be simple, single, successless love on her side alone.\n",
            "She might have been unconsciously sucking in the sad poison,\n",

            "\n",
            "Upon the whole, Emma left her with such softened, charitable feelings,\n",
            "as made her look around in walking home, and lament that Highbury\n",
